PayID Scanner Feature
The PayID scanner is an innovative addition to the bank's mobile app, designed to simplify and enhance the payment process. By utilizing QR code recognition technology, this feature allows users to quickly scan a recipient’s PayID details and auto-fill them into the payment form for Osko transactions. This eliminates the need for manual entry, making payments faster, more accurate, and user-friendly.

How It Works
Scan: Users select the "Scan PayID" option and use their device’s camera to capture the recipient’s QR code.
Decode: The app interprets the QR code to retrieve the embedded PayID information.
Auto-Fill: The PayID details are automatically populated into the payment fields.
Pay: Users review the details, enter the amount, and confirm the transaction via Osko.

Benefits to User Experience
Accuracy: Reduces errors from manually typing complex PayID details, ensuring payments go to the correct recipient.
Speed: Cuts down the time spent entering information, offering a seamless payment experience.
Convenience: Enables users to initiate payments effortlessly, even without prior knowledge of the recipient’s PayID.

This feature enhances the app’s usability, making it an intuitive tool for both frequent and occasional users of the Osko payment system.
